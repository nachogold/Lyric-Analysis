This script (html_to_sql_words.py) uses the site letras.com to crawl through song lyrics links of a specific genre and save song lyrics to a SQL database, with the option to do this for several genres.

Then, using another script (word_analysis.py), we retrieve the data from the database we built and use it to graph word frequency.

I did this to put into practice different Python tools (like website parsing, SQL and matplotlib, among others).

Any comments or ways to improve the code are welcome. 

Additionally, any suggestions of further analysis that could be done with the word frequency are appreciated.
